# Steam Game Analytics — Power BI Ready Data Model

This project transforms a raw dataset of games, reviews, achievements, and player interactions from the Steam platform into a clean, normalized **star schema** ready for use in Power BI or any modern BI tool.
The raw data used in this project was sourced from [Steam Game Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artyomkruglov/gaming-profiles-2025-steam-playstation-xbox/). We focus on the Steam platform but there are playstation and Xbox datasets as well.

## Overview

The dataset multi-valued fields, inconsistent dates, and deeply nested relationships which may not be ideal dor Power BI. In this project, we shall do the following tasks:

- Clean and validate data using pandas (missing values etc)
- Normalise multi-valued attributes like developers, genres, and publishers
- Create reusable dimension, fact, and bridge tables
- Add standardised date dimensions for temporal slicing
- Export a complete Power BI–ready schema
